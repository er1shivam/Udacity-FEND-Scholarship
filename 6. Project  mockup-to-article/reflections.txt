Your response goes here!

* I have learnt some new skills like making a sentence strong and emphasized at the same time   .
  Displaying a image in browser using img tag.
  Making a text to strikethrough.
  Writing a paragraph with hyperlinks and also to use "sup" tag to make a text superscript to another.

* Since this is the basics of html , everything was easy till now.

* It was a bit hard to manage the links , since they were mixed up easily. But overall everything seemed easy.

* I first started to make a tree like structure wherever possible. Also i tried using seperate paragraph tag for each paragraph
  to distinguish between different paragraph. I tried to make nested code structure to understand the code easily.
